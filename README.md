# Project Repository

Welcome to the Project Repository

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various machine learning problems as outlined in the provided set of questions. Below is a summary and guide to the different tasks included in this project.

## Table of Contents

1. [Task 1: Activation Functions and McCulloch-Pitts Neuron](#task-1-activation-functions-and-mcculloch-pitts-neuron)
   - [Question 1](#question-1): Analyze the impact of replacing the sigmoid activation function with ReLU in a binary classification network. Explain the advantages of ELU over ReLU.
   - [Question 2](#question-2): Design a network to classify points inside a triangular region defined in a plot. Develop and extend the provided code to visualize the results and understand the impact of different activation functions.
   
2. [Task 2: Multi-Class Classification with MLP](#task-2-multi-class-classification-with-mlp)
   - [Question 1](#question-1): Enhance the dataset from the CWRU Bearing dataset by adding additional classes for faulty conditions. Provide a brief description of each new class.
   - [Question 2](#question-2): Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with at least two hidden layers. Perform training and validation, visualize performance metrics, and analyze the results.
   - [Question 3](#question-3): Evaluate the effect of using different optimizers and loss functions on model performance. Compare and contrast the results.


3. [Task 3: Decision Tree Classification](#task-3-decision-tree-classification)
   - [Question 1](#question-1): Split a dataset related to forest or pharmaceutical classifications into training and test sets. Develop and analyze a decision tree classifier.
   - [Question 2](#question-2): Evaluate the classifier using a confusion matrix and at least three performance metrics. Assess the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the results.
   - [Question 3](#question-3): Improve classification performance using methods such as Random Forest or AdaBoost. Compare the results with previous implementations.

4. [Task 4: Heart Disease Dataset Classification](#task-4-heart-disease-dataset-classification)
   - [Question 1](#question-1): Split the heart disease dataset into training and test sets. Use Gaussian Naive Bayes for classification and analyze the results using classification reports.
   - [Question 2](#question-2): Compare performance between Micro and Macro averaging. Select five random test samples and compare predicted outputs with actual values.
