## Project Overview

This repository includes solutions to four main tasks: 
1. Implementing and analyzing a two-layer neural network with ReLU and sigmoid activations for binary classification. 
2. Extending a previous project to include more classes and training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the CWRU Bearing dataset. 
3. Designing and evaluating a decision tree for classifying forest cover types. 
4. Classifying heart disease data using Naive Bayes and evaluating the performance.
